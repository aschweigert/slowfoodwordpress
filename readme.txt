Slow Food WordPress Theme
Current Version: 0.1

== ABOUT ==

WordPress Theme developed by Adam Schweigert (@aschweig) of MediaToybox (http://mediatoybox.com) for Slow Food Columbus (http://slowfoodcolumbus.org).

Built using Twitter Bootstrap (http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/)

COMING SOON: working on bullet-proofing and extending the theme to create a version usable by other Slow Food chapters with minimal upfront investment.
